Reading Grant Achatz's book on Alinea is a pretty fair exercise in self-aggrandization, but there was a nice moment I pulled out.

There was a discussion about not wanting table linens and the of water glasses damaging table surfaces. They worked to find the correct water temperature that would not cause condensation, while also being appropriatly cool. They were able to retain the aesthetics of a clean looking table design w/out compromising on the customer's need for a refreshing drink.

I love reading about obsessive little details and how much people care to stay true to their vision. Anyone who has a concept and stays true to them while still serving the needs of their customers is the magic venn diagram of success.
