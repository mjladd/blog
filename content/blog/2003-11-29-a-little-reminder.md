> Until one is committed, there is hesitancy. 
> the chance to draw back,
> always ineffectiveness concerning all acts of initiative (and creation).
> There is one elemental truth,
> the ignorance of which kills countless ideas
> and splendid plans - - -
> that the moment one definitely commits oneself,
> then Providence moves all.
> All sorts of things occur to help one
> that would never otherwise have occurred.
> A whole stream of events issue from the decision,
> raising in one's favor all manner of incidents
> and meetings and material assistance
> which no one could have dreamed would come his or her way.

> Whatever you can do or dream, you can begin it.
> Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.
> Begin it now.
