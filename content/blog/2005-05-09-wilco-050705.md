Got to see Wilco again this weekend. The last night of a four night run at the Vic Theatre. All for nights were being taped for a DVD due out this fall. Pretty amazing set list, but the technical issues hurt the momentum a bit. Yep, that is indeed 35 songs. The band looked wiped out when the show ended (8:15 to 11:59).
