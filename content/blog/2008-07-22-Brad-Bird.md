Just got back from vacation and trying to catch up on email, rss feeds and laundry.

Came across this quote yesterday that I really liked.

*“In my experience, the thing that has the most significant impact on a movie’s budget–but never shows up in a budget–is morale. If you have low morale, for every $1 you spend, you get about 25 cents of value. If you have high morale, for every $1 you spend, you get about $3 of value. Companies should pay much more attention to morale.”*
- Brad Bird
