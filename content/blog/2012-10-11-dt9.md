With life about to get a lot busier, I wanted to finish a bit of [music](http://mjladd.com/music.html). For the last year, every piece of music I wrote I hated immediately afterwards. I threw out a half-dozen tracks and started over. 

Most of this was done very quickly, often recording single takes and cleaning up afterwards. The production is a little sloppy at times, but I focused mostly on the song itself, ensuring the form of the tune was tight and the melodies memorable (which is a change from my usual focus on texture).
