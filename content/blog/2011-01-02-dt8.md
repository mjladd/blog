I finished <a href="http://www.mjladd.com/music">DT8</a> over vacation. It was written in fits and starts over the last three/four months in quick chunks whenever I could grab some time. Mostly written in the early morning hours when I couldn't sleep (2:30-5am mostly and a few rushed lunch hours at home). 

This was the first time I spend the cash and starting adding live instruments to the recordings.
