Heading out in the morning for the big east coast trip. Three/Four cities in one week (Boston, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia). It is the first vacation we've been able to take in nearly three years, so I'm pretty excited. It'll be nice to be able to visit with friends as well.

The worse thing about AM flights is that I can never sleep well. I'll probably end up waking up 5-6 times and being unable to sleep on the flight. The iphone is loaded with enough music, tv shows, and Ted presentations to keep me occupied, along with a 600 page Hunter S. Thompson book ('72 Campaign, to keep in the spirit of visiting DC).
