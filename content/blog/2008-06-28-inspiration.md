Simultaneously inspiring and ego damaging to read about someone (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Sinclair">Cameron Sinclair</a>) my own age doing such amazing work.  His Ted <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=c_sinclair">video</a> is well worth watching. People like him really make me ask why I am wasting my life and how can I move forward.

As much as the Ted stuff can be accused of being elitist, there is some goddamned inspiring work.
