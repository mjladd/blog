## Michael J. Ladd: Resume| [GitHub](http://github.com/mjladd) | [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/mjladd) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjladd)

I am Michael J. Ladd (mjladd-at-gmail). I work as a Director of Systems Administration for iProspect. In a former life I attempted to be a musician. While studying music, I discovered that I was far better at troubleshooting technology than writing fugues and analyzing symphonies. I have a Bachelor of Music degree, a Masters of Music and graduated from the MSIT program at Northwestern University.
